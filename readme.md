#  Hi, I'm Bernardo Forcillo! <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px">

I'm a **Full-Stack Engineer** brimming with enthusiasm for problem-solving using computer science. Based in Bernalda, South Italy, I'm fueled by a deep passion for science, math, and all things intriguing. I'm currently pursuing a CS degree to further sharpen my skills, and this is my hub for open-sourcing projects and embracing the thrill of exploration (and maybe breaking a few things along the way – that's how we learn, right?). 

**Currently on my learning odyssey:**

-  **Computer Science:** Studing Java, Kotlin, Algorithms and Computers.
-  **DevOps:** Building and automating robust software delivery pipelines.
-  **Flutter and GoLang:** Diving into the world of mobile development and exploring the power of Go.

**Areas I'm particularly fascinated by:**

-  **Self-Supervised Learning:** Unlocking the potential of machines to learn autonomously.
-  **Data Science:** Extracting insights from the ever-growing ocean of data.
-  **Neuroscience:** Bridging the gap between the human brain and the computational world.

**Beyond coding, you might find me:**

-  Devouring books (especially those that offer life-improvement hacks).

##  My Tech Toolbox

I'm always eager to learn new tools, but here's what I currently use to craft amazing things:

- **Front-End:**
    -  JavaScript/TypeScript (for interactive UIs)
    - ‍ React.js/Next.js (for building beautiful and performant web applications)
    -  Flutter (and  Dart) (for creating stunning mobile apps)
- **Back-End:**
    - ️ Golang (for building powerful backends)
    -  Python and  TensorFlow (for machine learning, deep learning, and AI explorations)
- **DevOps:**
    - ️ Kubernetes (k3s-io) for container orchestration
    -  Docker (containerd and podman) for containerization magic
- **Design:**
    - ‍ Figma (for crafting sleek mockups and designs)
- **Plus a sprinkle of:** PHP, Java, C#, C++ (though a bit rusty, I'm always up for a refresh!)

**And the learning journey continues...** 

This list is just the beginning. I'm constantly on the lookout for new technologies to expand my skillset and tackle even more exciting challenges. Let's connect and explore the world of tech together!
