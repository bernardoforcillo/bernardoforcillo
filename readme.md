# Hi, I'm Bernardo Forcillo  <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px">

I'm a full-stack developer, backend more focussed, who love solve problems with Computer Science, based in Bernalda, South Italy. I'm appasionate by science, math and everything interesting. I'm also following a CS degree 🎓 (part-time). This is the place where I opensource stuff and break things.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on something cool 😉
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Flutter, Deep / Reinforcement / Self Supervesed learning, Data Science & Neuroscience(Medical and Computational) 🤓
- 📚 Sometimes I read books (mostly about how to suck less in life)
